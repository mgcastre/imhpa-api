# API for IMHPA Data

## Notes
There are three types of data that the user can access: 
1. Up to date high frequency data (15 min) that the user can download from the present to up to a month before (that is the maximum that is available in the website). This can be accessed in the "/estaciones-satelitales" sub-folder (sub-page).
2. Historical meteorological data. This unfortunately are not historical records, but historical monthly averages of different stations across the country. Can be accessed with the "/clima-historicos" sub-folder.
3. Historical hydrological data (streamflows) can also be accessed and downloaded. Same as before, it is monthly averages for a handful of stations. They are in the "/hidrologicos-historicos" sub-folder.
